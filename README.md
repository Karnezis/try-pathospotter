# Try Pathospotter
JavaScript version of the already online website Try PathoSpotter.

# How to Use
Using the interface available on the "index.html" file, access the website. Then, you can upload a kidney biopsy to the website. For better accuracy, submit only images with one glomerulus stained using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) or Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS). Then, wait some seconds for the result. The time the website will take computing the diagnostic can vary accordingly with your browser and hardware. The website will tell you if that biopsy shows signs of sclerosis and hypercellularity.

  <h3 align="center">PathoSpotter Classifier</h3>

  <p align="center">
    PathoSpotter is a computational tool built to help pathologists. This repository intends to improve the already operational, yet not optimal, tool entitled Classifier. This project intends to have a fast and secure website so nephropathologists can upload their glomerulus images and receive an accurate precision classification of sclerosis and hypercellularity lesions.</p>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Imagine having a physician colleague, always available to give you his guesses and advices when it comes to diagnosis. This is what this tool is simulating. Our neural networks were trained to see the hypercellularity, and sclerosis lesions in glomeruli. This tool by no means replaces the need of a trained physician, but intends to be a useful second opinion tool in  the nephropathology context.

### Built With

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=pt-br)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Karnezis/try-pathospotter.git
   ```
2. For easier access, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and it's [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

3. Press the "Go Live" extension button.

4. Access the website in the link specified.

## Usage

First, upload an image to the system. Then, click the button to submit it. Now wait for the results. _Ta-da!_

## Tips

Empty (for now).
