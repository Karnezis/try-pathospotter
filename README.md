# How to Use
Using the interface available on the "index.html" file, access the website. Then, you can upload a kidney biopsy to the website. For better accuracy, submit only images with one glomerulus stained using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) or Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS). Then, wait some seconds for the result. The time the website will take computing the diagnostic can vary accordingly with your browser and hardware. The website will tell you if that biopsy shows signs of sclerosis and hypercellularity.
